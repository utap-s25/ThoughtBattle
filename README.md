ThoughtBattle is a debate platform where users can engage in discussions on a wide range of topics. Users can create new debates by defining two opposing sides, or they can join existing debates. Upon joining a debate, users can choose to support one side, or remain neutral. Each debate chat includes an information tab that provides auto-generated resources and context about the debate topic. For example, in a debate about "Brittney Spears vs. Christina Aguilera," the app would provide information about each artist, as well as a correlation detailing their shared history (e.g., their time on Mickey Mouse Club and their public rivalry).
The app also features automated moderation powered by AI. Users have profiles which will display their debate history.
